#' @title Computing Beta-Deviation
#'
#' @description This function computes observed beta-diversity (community variability), expected beta-diversity and beta-deviation for a given grouping factor. It strongly rely on functions from package `vegan`
#'
#' @param com The community data. A species by site matrix containing abundance or presence/absence data.
#' @param group a grouping factor to compute community variability
#' @param method The chosen null model algorithm. See help file from the `permatswap` function in package `vegan`. Defaut is set to "quasiswap"
#' @param dist The beta-diversity metric to be used. Default is set to bray-curtis beta dissimilarity.
#' @param fixedmar character, stating which of the row/column sums should be preserved ("none", "rows", "columns", "both"). Defaut is to "both".
#' @param shuffle Character, indicating whether individuals ("ind"), samples ("samp") or both ("both") should be shuffled, see details.
#' @param strata Numeric vector or factor with length same as nrow(m) for grouping rows within strata for restricted permutations. Unique values or levels are used. It is usefull to keep gamma-diversity within treatments constant. Defaut is set to "NULL".
#' @param mtype Matrix data type, either "count" for count data, or "prab" for presence-absence type incidence data. Defaut is set to "count".
#' @param times Number of permuted matrices. Defaut is set to 1000.
#' @param burning Number of null communities discarded before proper analysis in sequential ("swap", "tswap") methods. Defaut is set to 0.
#' @param thin Number of discarded permuted matrices between two evaluations in sequential ("swap", "tswap") methods. Defaut is set to 1.
#' @param transform A character. Should the community matrix values be transformed? Default is set to "NULL". Options here are the same as for the `decostand` function from `vegan`.
#' @param seed Do you wish set a seed? Defaut is to "NULL"
#' @export
