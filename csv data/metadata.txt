environmental_data.csv

A dataset containing information on the environmental variables measured in each of the three surveys. The exception is canopy cover, which was measured only once. It also contains pond IDs and treatments (fish and isolation).

depth - Average depth (cm) of each pond
conductivity - Water conductivity (ÂµS/cm) of each pond
ph - Water pH in each pond
do - Dissolved Oxygen (mg/L) in each pond
turbidity - Water turbidity (NTU) in each pond
clorophylla_a - Clorophyll-a (RFU) values in each pond
phycocyanin - Phycocyanin (RFU) values in each pond
canopy - canopy cover value (%) (from four different measurements) in each pond. Measured only in the last survey.
